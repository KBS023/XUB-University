<font style="font-size: 150%; font-family: sans-serif;">Dubbed the new ‘elixir’ of the World of Business and Technology, global investments in cognitive and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions are said to reach upwards of 50+% compound annual growth rate hitting US$57 billion in 2021. By 2018 alone 2.5 quintillion bytes of data were created each day, but that pace is only accelerating. India’s current digital profile includes 123 cr (crore) Aadhaar users, 118 cr mobile users, 50 cr internet users, and 25 cr on ‘social networks.’ This combination of ‘big data’ and machine learning (ML) has seismic impacts on society, business, education, and policy. AI strategy is increasingly deemed as a significant competitive advantage (or even crucial to corporate survival) for many businesses including healthcare. However, NASSCOM in 2018 reported 1.4 lakhs jobs remaining vacant in AI and Big Data in India. It’s an exciting time to study computer science and engineering. AI innovations and allied technologies such as big-data & analytics, cloud computing, robotics, internet-of-everything systems, software-defined advanced communication, smart & green tech, and digital security will revolutionize how we live and work, and usher in the age of the bio-physical-informatic world. Come and learn to shape this future at Xavier School of Computer Science & Engineering!</font>
